    - The navigation bar has a consistent look and placement on all platforms and sections of the website to support easy navigation.  It includes a simple Logo to the left, Home, Gallery and Contact links to the right. The navigation bar is responsive on multiple screen sizes. When navigating around the site the active page will be displayed with a light blue underline along with a white underline when hovering over navigation links for each section. clicking or tapping the logo will also bring the user back to the main home section.

      ![Navbar](documentation/supp-images/navigation-bar.jpg)
    

-   __Landing Page image, company name and design/environment descriptions__

    - The landing/home page includes a large image of a 3D printer on a stylistic background and large text to the right side with descriptive information on what the company does as well as the materials used. The bright purple colours and large font is intended to stand out and bring the user's gaze down to the services and materials information whilst staying in line with the company's logo scheme.

      ![Landing Area](documentation/supp-images/landing-area.jpg)

- __Tagline__

    - The "3D PRINTED INLINE SKATE HARDWARE" tagline appears on the main page with inverted colours to stand out and let the user know exactly the services the company provides whilst keeping in theme to the company logo.

      ![Tagline](documentation/supp-images/tagline.jpg)

- __Gallery page__

    - The gallery page is to show large clear images of existing products the company has produced thus far. Hovering over the images on desktop platforms not only increases their size but also applies a bright blue border to make it easier for the user to see the images clearly. On mobile and tablet platforms tapping the images provides the same bright border and size increase while staying responsive and resizing down to two columns on mobile platforms keeping images large and clear.
    
      ![Gallery](documentation/supp-images/gallery-features.jpg)

- __Contact Page__

    - The contact page is a large easy-to-read contact form consisting of first name, last name, email address, message box and a submit button. The contact form has a bright blue outline around each box to help the user identify the different sections along with placeholder text to show the user what information needs to be input into each section of the form. Every section is required to be populated to help the company easily identify the user and respond via email directly. The submit button has a bright purple colouring and highlights blue when hovered over to show the user they need to click to submit the information they provided. The information provided by the user is a bright purple keeping on the theme of the company's logo for the contact form as a whole. The large style of the contact form is responsive on each platform making it easy for the user to read and fill out.


      ![Contact form](documentation/supp-images/contact-form.jpg)

- __Footer__

    - The footer bar sits at the end of the page sections at the bottom of the viewport. Holding copyright information on the left with social media icons for Hexi Skate Hardware's Instagram, Facebook and Twitter account on the right. The social media Icons highlight in blue when hovering over them and open the social media websites in separate tabs within the browser for the user to explore further. This colouring stays in line with the rest of the site's theme.

    
      ![Footer](documentation/supp-images/footer.jpg)

- __How these features support the User Stories__

    - The current features in the website help users achieve the user stories mentioned in the [User Experience (UX)](#user-experience-ux) part of this document. They are clear, themed and coloured consistently across the whole site and link to where the user wants to go whilst the information on the site is easily readable and to the point.


### Features which could be implemented in the future

- __Direct eCommerce store page__
    - A 'Store' page could be added to provide an easier and more direct way for users to browse and purchase in-house designed items that are not custom to the user's needs.

- __Navigation bar improvements__
    - The navigation bar could be switched to a hamburger-style icon to help save space when additional pages like the store are added on smaller devices such as tablets and mobile

- __Image rotator__
    - An image rotator on the main splash page to cycle through "featured" designs and items available would help users instantly see what's new.   


## Design

-   ### Website style
    - The style of the website chosen was a single-page format. This allows the user to not only navigate to each section from the nav bar but also scroll through the entire website at their leisure.

-   ### Imagery
    -  The large and bright 3D Printer image has been chosen because it is eye-catching and bright this draws the user's line of sight and shows the user the technologies used. The Purple and light colours in the image background were chosen to help convey a parody of the company's logo. The Large bright purple font takes the user's eyes naturally across the screen and guides them down to the information about what the company does and the materials they use.

-   ### Colour Scheme
    -  A light airy and modern colour scheme is used to keep parody with the company's existing logo colour scheme. Utilising a dark background for the website helps the content "pop" making it easier on the eyes than a white background, whilst providing a contrast with the website content to help keep readability high.

        ![Colour Palette](documentation/supp-images/color-theme.jpg)

-   ### Typography
    -   Google Fonts were used to import Open Sans and sans-serif fonts into styles.css.  These were chosen as they work well together and have a simple, unembellished, modern feel that is easy to read.


-   ### Wireframes

    -   #### All Wireframes

## Testing

### Validator Testing

- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

    - Result for index.html (whole single-page website)

      ![HTML results index](documentation/validation-results/my-html-report.jpg)


- [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

    - Result for my style.css

      ![My CSS result](documentation/validation-results/my-css-style-sheet-report.jpg)

    - Result for website CSS

      ![Site CSS result](documentation/validation-results/font-awesome-css-errors.jpg)
    The warnings seem to be due to the import of the Font awesome icons.

- [Light House Validation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/)

    - Result for desktop

      ![Desktop Lighthouse](documentation/validation-results/lighthouse-score-desktop.jpg)

    - Result for Mobile

      ![Mobile Lighthouse](documentation/validation-results/lighthouse-score-mobile.jpg)  


### Browser Compatibility

- Testing has been carried out on the following browsers :
    - Chrome Version Version 108.0.5359.99 (Official Build) (64-bit)
    - Firefox Version 88.0.1 (64-bit)
    - Microsoft Edge Version 108.0.1462.46 (Official Build) (64-bit)
    - Safari on macOS Catalina (Safari  Version 16.2)
    
### Test Cases and Results

- To completely test the website I performed the following manual testing on the various browsers mentioned above and devices (windows desktop, Samsung Galaxy S20+, iPhone). 

  I also went through the website using Chromes developer tools to  ensure the site was responsive and aligned correctly on 
smaller desktops (laptops), tablets and mobile devices.

_Nav bar testing_

- Test each link on the nav bar. Each link took me to the relevant section required, the Logo took me home as expected. The nav bar stayed in place when scrolling ensuring the user has access to navigation at all times. Nav "active" page effect works as expected when clicking between pages and underlines blue.

_Footer testing_

- Test each social media Icon. Each social media icon link opened the relevant social media website in a new tab as expected when clicked. Footer behaved how I expected appearing at the bottom of the site when the user scrolls or navigates down to the last section (Contact).

_Nav and footer hover effects testing_

- Test the expected result of the hover effect on the nav links (Home, Gallery, Contact) as well as the social media icon links on the footer. All nav links and social media icons behaved as expected when hovering over with the mouse, Nav links were underlined white and the social icons lit up blue as expected

_Gallery image hover testing_

- Test the expected result of the hover effect on the Gallery images. All images behaved as expected when hovering over them with the mouse. All images increased in scale by 10% when hovering.

### Known bugs

- Nav bar doesn't update when scrolling between the sections of the webpage when moving down. This requires Java Script from what I could find out and the code examples found I couldn't get working and had to drop the idea due to time constraints and a lack of JavaScript knowledge.
