HeXi Skate Hardware is a site for a fictional company specialising in the design and making of 3D-printed inline skate hardware. The company sells custom design and print services to people who need a replacement part for their inline skates or who just want something different from stock. The site will be used to showcase to potential customers the types of products designed and used by existing customers and allow them to send in requests for products they may need via the contact form.

    - The landing/home page includes a large image of a 3D printer on a stylistic background and large text to the right side with descriptive information on what the company does as well as the materials used. The bright purple colours and large font is intended to stand out and bring the users gaze down to the services and materials information whilst staying in line with the companies logo scheme.

- __Tagline__

    - The "3D PRINTED INLINE SKATE HARDWARE" tagline appears on the main page with inverted colors to stand out and let the user know exactly the services the company provides whilst keeping in theme to the company logo.

      ![Tagline](documentation/supp-images/tagline.jpg)

- __Gallery page__

    - The gallery page is to show large clear images of existing products the company has produced thus far. Hovering over the images on desktop platforms not only increases their size but also applying a bright blue border to make it easier for user to see the images clearly. On mobile and tablet platforms tapping the images provides the same bright border and size increase while staying responsive and resizing down to two columns on mobile platforms keeping images large and clear.
    
      ![Gallery](documentation/supp-images/gallery-features.jpg)

The contact form has a bright blue outline around each box to help the user identify the different sections along with placeholder text to show the user what information needs to be input into each section of the form. Every section is required to be populated to help the company easily identify the user and respond via email directly. The submit button has a bright purple coloring and highlights blue when hovered over to show the user they need to click to submit the information they provided.

- __How these features support the User Stories__

    - The current features in the website help users achieve the user stories mentioned in the [User Experience (UX)](#user-experience-ux) part of this document. They are clear, themed and colored consistantly across the whole site and link to where the user wants to go whilst the information on the site is easily readable and to the point.


### Features which could be implemented in the future

- __Direct Ecommerce store page__
    - A 'Store' page could be added to provide an easier and more direct way for users to browse and purchase in house designed items that are not custom to the users needs.

- __Navigation bar improvements__
    - The navigation bar could be switched to a hamburger style icon to help save space when additional pages like the store are added on smaller devices such as tablet and mobile

- __Image rotator__
    - An image rotator on the main splash page to cycle through "featured" designs and items available would help users instantly see what's new.   


## Design

-   ### Imagery
    -   The hero and large background images have been chosen because they are eye-catching, fresh and bright.  The citrus and light pastel colours in the images were chosen to help convey a sense of energy, health and freshness.  The images depict fruit to align with the main business goal of selling juices and smoothies and were chosen for their "simplicity" (- e.g. a single type of fruit or repeating theme) to help keep the site clear and easy to use.

-   ### Colour Scheme
    -  A citrus/pastel palette was chosen to convey a fresh, energetic mood.  The colours picked were inspired by a palette from [Lily Bug Design](https://www.lilybugdesign.co.nz/colour-wall)

        ![Colour Palette](documentation/supp-images/citruspalette.png)

-   ### Typography
    -   Google Fonts were used to import Lato and Oswald fonts into styles.css.  These were chosen as they work well together and have a simple, unembellished, modern feel that is easy to read.


-   ### Wireframes

    -   #### Main Page Wireframes
